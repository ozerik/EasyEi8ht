This user manual has been updated for software version 2_0.2.2
 
Mode 1: R/P
Record/Play
Hitting any key will enter that trigger into the nearest slot in the quanitzed pattern. If you play the keys sloppily, the unquantized triggers will play and sound sloppy until the pattern starts repeating, when if you continue to play that pattern sloppily, you'll be hearing double-triggers
Holding the shift key and pressing any key toggles mute for that channel. The pattern is stored unless:
Hitting the key of a muted channel erases the pattern and lets you enter a new pattern
 
Mode 2: FS
Freestyle
There’s three freestyle modes, indicated by which key’s LED is dark.
FS Mode 1: hitting a key rolls triggers for that channel. They aren’t recorded. Holding shift mutes all tracks besides the track or tracks you are active playing
FS Mode 2: hitting a key rolls triggers for that channel, same as mode 1. Holding shift plays any pressed key's triggers at twice the clock speed for 32nd notes
FS Mode 3: this is a breakbeat/glitch mode. The keys play one, two, three, four, seven or eight, or random, pattern steps on repeat. The pattern stays on track in the background, so when you release the key your beat will be in the correct spot. Holding the shift key in this mode will create 32nd beat fills, letting you create truly monster glitch fills in your drum patterns.
 
 
Mode 3: CNF
Configuration
  Key|Function                                                   
 ---|------------------------------------------------------------
 shift+1  | Sets the sequence length shorter, to a minimum of 16 beats   
2 | Cycles through the three freestyle modes
shift+3  | Sets the sequence length longer, to a maximum of 256 beats*
4|While stopped, this key moves the sequence to a previous step
4+shift+5 | While self-clocked, this button combination stops the playback
5|While stopped, this key moves the sequence forward a step
6 |Swing value change
shift+7|Saves many of the parameters of the module to memory, to be recalled across power cycles
8|Swing value changes the other way
2+shift+7| Deletes the entire trigger pattern all at once
shift|Once the module's clock is stopped, either by using an external clock source and stopping it or by using the internal clock and stopping the module with 4+shift+5, pressing the shift key starts the module clock and resumes playback. Tapping the shift key repeatedly allows you to input a tempo.
Holding the shift key for two seconds toggles the flashing tempo-indicating-LED under the shift key.
 
 
While the module is in configuration mode, all but one of the LEDs will light dimly. The LED that isn’t lit shows which freestyle mode is active.
 
When the switch is in CNF mode, tapping the shift key allows you to tap a steady rhythm into the module and it will average the taps and set a tempo.
 
Tapping the shift key in a tempo first establishes a few taps, then zeroes out part of the average that's already been input, and then up to 20 taps get averaged. Fewer taps is okay, just not as precise. More taps roll over. One missed tap or accidental switch-bounce problems get ignored.
