## Mode 1: R/P
Record/Play
Hitting any key will enter that trigger into the nearest slot in the quanitzed pattern. If you play the keys sloppily, the unquantized triggers will play and sound sloppy until the pattern starts repeating, when if you continue to play that pattern sloppily, you'll be hearing double-triggers
Tapping the shift key lights the shift key LED to a flickering on state, meaning the next trigger key you press will mute or unmute that channel. Tapping the shift key again is like saying "nevermind, I didn't want to mute any tracks"
Hitting the key of a muted channel erases the pattern and lets you enter a new pattern
Holding the shift lets you hold down a key and 16th note triggers will be entered into the pattern
 
## Mode 2: FS
Freestyle
There’s three freestyle modes, indicated by which key’s LED is dark.

FS Mode 1: hitting a key rolls triggers for that channel. They aren’t recorded. Holding shift mutes all tracks besides the track or tracks you are active playing

FS Mode 2: hitting a key rolls triggers for that channel, same as mode 1. Holding shift plays any pressed key's triggers at twice the clock speed for 32nd notes

FS Mode 3: this is a breakbeat/glitch mode. The keys play one, two, three, four, seven or eight, or random, pattern steps on repeat. The pattern stays on track in the background, so when you release the key your beat will be in the correct spot. Holding the shift key in this mode will create 32nd beat fills, letting you create truly monster glitch fills in your drum patterns.
 
 
## Mode 3: CNF
Configuration
  Key|Function                                                   
 ---|------------------------------------------------------------
 shift+1  | Sets the sequence length shorter, to a minimum of 16 beats   
2 | Cycles through the three freestyle modes
shift+3  | Sets the sequence length longer, to a maximum of 256 beats*
4|While stopped, this key moves the sequence to a previous step
4+shift+5 | While self-clocked, this button combination stops the playback
5|While stopped, this key moves the sequence forward a step
6 |Swing value change
shift+7|Saves many of the parameters of the module to memory, to be recalled across power cycles
8|Swing value changes the other way
2+shift+7| Deletes the entire trigger pattern all at once
shift|Once the module's clock is stopped, either by using an external clock source and stopping it or by using the internal clock and stopping the module with 4+shift+5, pressing the shift key starts the module clock and resumes playback (this will happen no matter what position the mode switch is in). Tapping the shift key repeatedly allows you to input a tempo. Holding the shift key for two seconds toggles the flashing tempo-indicating-LED under the shift key.
 
While the module is in configuration mode, all but one of the LEDs will light dimly. The LED that isn’t lit shows which freestyle mode is active.
